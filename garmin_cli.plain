***definitions***

- :CLI: is the command-line interface entry point.
- :FetchCommand: is the command to retrieve data from Garmin.
- :ChatCommand: is the command to start the interactive chat session.

***technical specs***

- The entry point for the :CLI: must be a file named "main.py".
- Use the "argparse" library to handle command-line arguments.

***test specs***

- :CLI: tests must verify:
  - Correct routing of commands to app logic
  - Handling of missing environment variables
  - Graceful exit on "exit" command during chat

***functional specs***

- Implement the functionality where the user calls :CLI: and the application starts.
  - First, trigger the fetch workflow in :GarminChatApp:, providing visual feedback that data is being saved to "garmin_data.json".
  - Then, trigger the chat workflow in :GarminChatApp:, maintaining a persistent loop until the user types "exit" or "quit" and printing the LLM responses clearly to the console.
