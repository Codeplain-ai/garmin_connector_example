***definitions***

- :CLI: is the command-line interface entry point.

***implementation reqs***

- The entry point for the :CLI: must be a file named "garmin_chat.py".

***test reqs***

- :CLI: tests must verify:
  - Handling of missing environment variables
  - Graceful exit on "exit" command during chat

***functional specs***

- Implement the functionality where the user calls :CLI: and the application starts.
  - First, trigger the fetch workflow in :GarminChatApp:, providing visual feedback that data is being saved to "garmin_data.json".
  - Then, trigger the chat workflow in :GarminChatApp:, maintaining a persistent loop until the user types "exit" or "quit" and printing the LLM responses clearly to the console.
