***implementation reqs***

- Use the "garminconnect" Python package to implement the :GarminClient:.
- The implementation should be located in the "src/garmin" folder.

***functional specs***

- Initialize the :GarminClient: and retrieve activities for any type of running
  - Use GARMIN_EMAIL and GARMIN_PASSWORD for authentication
  - Support session persistence to avoid re-authentication on every call
  - The retrieved activities should have the string "running" in the activityType.
  - Retrieve the activities available for the user in the last 180 days.
  - For every retrieved :ActivitySummary:, obtain the associated :LapData: for each lap.

  ***acceptance tests***
  - The :GarminClient: should return a list of :ActivitySummary: objects. Each :ActivitySummary: must contain a non-empty list of :LapData: if laps were recorded.
  - There should be more than 1 activity retrieved for the period of 180 days.
  - There should be heart rate data for at least one of the activities.

- Implement funtions to Save and Load activities to and from file.
  - Save: Convert a list of :ActivitySummary: and their :LapData: into a JSON-serializable format
  - Save: Write the serialized data to :DataFile:
  - Save: Overwrite existing data in the file if it exists
  - Load: Read the content of :DataFile:
  - Load: Parse the JSON content into a format usable by the LLM
  - Load: Return an error if the file does not exist or is corrupted
